# Artificial artificial artificial intelligence (in progress)
This is an **in progress** repository of the paper. 

### Structure
1. Process the original responses (`0_exploration.ipynb`)
2. Generate new responses using ChatGPT (`1_generation.ipynb`)
3. Prepare training data (`2_prepare_for_training.ipynb`)
4. Train model (see below)
5. Plotting and detection (`3_finetuned_classifying.ipynb`)

###Â Fine-tuning the model (merging with main repository)
Model finetuning was largely based on the code-repository found [here](https://github.com/AGMoller/worker_vs_gpt/). We are currently in the process of adding the relevant fine-tuning code here.
