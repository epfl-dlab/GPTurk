Adjuvant Exemestane with an aromatase inhibitor, or hormone receptor, is shown to improve outcomes, as compared to tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression. A five-year follow-up in the  Exemestane group showed a disease-free survival rate at 91.1 % compared to the Tamoxifen group with a 87.3% survival rate. The rate of freedom from cancer at five years was at nearly 93% in the Exemestane group as compared to about 89% in the Tamoxifen group. In the study of 4690 patients, there were 194 deaths. The overall survival rate did not differ significantly between the two groups. Adverse reactions were similar in both groups.

They found this by studying the clinical trial data from 4690 patients from two separate trials. The 5 year survival rate was 91% for aromatase inhibitor and 87% for tamoxifen. The researchers had a fairly high confidence in that result. However, the group that was treated with the aromatase inhibitor had a slightly elevated risk for adverse side effects as opposed to those treated with the tamoxifen. In summary, the research found that women treated with adjuvant treatment with exemstane plus ovarian suppression medication were more likely to stay in remission after their breast cancer had been treated, as opposed to the tamoxifen group.

Since mammography was introduced in the U.S., the number of early stage cancer cases detected had doubled in just one year, while late stage cases declined.  Based on variables such as hormone-replacement therapy and other adjusted trends, the study concluded that breast cancer was overdiagnosed in 1.3 million women in the U.S. in the past 30 years.

Most people throughout the world get about 3.95g of sodium in their diet each day. There were 1.65 million deaths from cardiovascular disease in 2010. Research discovered that many of these deaths were in people who had a much greater intake of sodium than the 3.95 per day. Many of these deaths were in low and middle income countries and were premature - meaning the person died before they should have. The country that was the most affected by this was Georgia but Kenya was least affected. This is why researchers are now saying that we should do our best to keep our sodium intake to around 2g per day.

Women's risks differed a bit - women drinking less than one cup had a hazard ratio of 1.01, and those drinking six or more cups were at a ratio of 0.85.

Over eight hundred overweight adults were put on a selected diet, chosen from four different compositions of these macronutrients. While all four diets had different compositions, they contained similar foods. Each participant had lost about six kilograms after six months of group or individual instructional sessions helping them maintain either a diet low in fat, protein, or carbohydrates. Each diet had a similar effect on the participant's weight, showing that a reduced calorie diet will be helpful in weight loss regardless of macronutrient composition. Participants also reported similar satisfaction and hunger levels and improved their lipid-related risk factors and fasting insulin levels.

On average, participants gained an average of 3.35 pounds. What appeared to have a substantial effect was the increased intake of chips, potatoes, added sugar, unprocessed and processed meat. All of these showed a marked increase in weight gain on average. Increased consumption of vegetable, whole grains, fruit, nuts, and yogurt actually had the opposite effect and showed an decrease in weight across those 4 years on average. &#13;&#13;Other lifestyle change such as alcohol use, smoking, sleep, and watching television also appeared to have an effect that varied across participants.</FreeText></Answer></QuestionFormAnswers>",2018-08-27 00:07:37+02:00,3LUY3GC630LMZKBKDFQYH52O1V87PX,Approved,2018-08-27 00:07:00+02:00,31GN6YMHLPDVG7VJN2X3F6ASPL2WS3,NEJMoa1014296,2018-08-26 16:07:00+02:00,0 days 00:17:55.000000000,AZYUCL6B0YROY,,,"{""Education"": ""Some College"", ""Age"": ""24-39"", ""Gender"": ""male"", ""1_1"": true, ""1_2"": true, ""1_3"": true, ""1_4"": true, ""1_5"": true, ""1_6"": true, ""1_7"": true, ""1_8"": true, ""2"": false, ""3_1"": true, ""3_2"": true, ""3_3"": true, ""4"": false, ""5"": false, ""6"": false, ""7"": true, ""8"": false, ""9"": false}",

Specifically, the vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella - referred to as the MMR vaccine - has been singled out as a cause. To determine if cause and effect can be determined, researchers obtained information from several Danish governmental record keepers on children born in Denmark over seven years, from 1991 to 1998. Of the almost 540,000 children studied, 440, 000 (or about 82%) had received the MMR vaccine. Of that total group, about 740 children had been diagnosed with some form of autism-spectrum disorder. Results comparing the rate of autism diagnosis in vaccinated versus non-vaccinated children showed no statistically significant connection between the vaccine and an autism diagnosis, even when controlled for factors like a child's age when he or she was vaccinated or the interval between vaccination and diagnosis of the disorder. The results of the study show that there is no evidence of a link between MMR vaccinations and development of autism. </FreeText></Answer></QuestionFormAnswers>",2018-09-21 06:51:01+02:00,3L6L49WXW1ILNNBIR2JDGNDXOJ545X,Approved,2018-09-21 06:50:03+02:00,39KV3A5D18SGQSUIFUPRNQBBXKF7SF,NEJMoa021134,2018-09-20 22:50:03+02:00,0 days 00:10:03.000000000,A1SXNLUT6WM90L,,,,"{""Education"": ""College"", ""Age"": ""40-60"", ""Gender"": ""female"", ""1"": true, ""2"": true, ""3"": true, ""4"": true, ""5"": true, ""6"": true, ""7"": false, ""8"": true}"

The study had a 95% confidence interval. Therefore it can be concluded a study should be conducted with children receiving either more than 5 doses or with a longer interval between each of the first five doses.&#13;&#13;</FreeText></Answer></QuestionFormAnswers>",2018-09-21 07:25:01+02:00,3QFUFYSY9Z0DPK47XEWM2Z4ADDP4FM,Approved,2018-09-21 07:24:32+02:00,3HKIF5DF6YIHE69KZRTUC8JE4Z99G9,NEJMoa1200850,2018-09-20 23:24:32+02:00,0 days 00:25:32.000000000,A141OEKVSKTOP9,,,,"{""Education"": ""College"", ""Age"": ""40-60"", ""Gender"": ""female"", ""1"": true, ""2"": true, ""3"": true, ""4"": true, ""5"": true, ""6"": true, ""7"": false, ""8"": true}"

It is unknown how long the DTaP vaccine is effective after the 5 doses. A case control study, from 2006 - 2011, was conducted to determine the risk of pertussis in children in California (Kaiser Permanente Northern California members vaccinated with DTaP between 47 to 84 months) after the 5th dose of DTaP. &#13;Children (ages 4 - 12) with pertussis confirmed by a positive polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay were compared to pertussis PCR negative children and closely matched controls from the general population of health plan members. Statistical analysis was used to determine the risk of pertussis relative to the duration of time since the 5th DTaP dose. The study found PCR positive children were more likely to have received the 5th DTaP dose earlier that PCR negative controls or matched controls . After the 5th dose of DTaP the odds of getting pertussis increased by an average of 42% per year with odds ratio of 1.42 (95% Confidence interval 1.21 to 1.66)</FreeText></Answer></QuestionFormAnswers>",2018-09-21 11:13:01+02:00,37ZHEEHM6X7FSV6XFHTR42ZN1RY37O,Approved,2018-09-21 11:12:21+02:00,3HKIF5DF6YIHE69KZRTUC8JE4Z99G9,NEJMoa1200850,2018-09-21 03:12:21+02:00,0 days 00:34:46.000000000,A3A5AKXXPFA08I,,,,"{""Education"": ""College"", ""Age"": ""40-60"", ""Gender"": ""female"", ""1"": true, ""2"": true, ""3"": true, ""4"": true, ""5"": true, ""6"": true, ""7"": false, ""8"": true}"
