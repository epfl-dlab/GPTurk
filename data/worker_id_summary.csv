After excluding the transient excess incidence associated with hormone-replacement therapy and adjusting for trends in the incidence of breast cancer among women younger than 40 years of age, we estimated that breast cancer was overdiagnosed (i.e., tumors were detected on screening that would never have led to clinical symptoms) in 1.3 million U.S. women in the past 30 years.

A2JCFYRKX5IZFL,"Our analysis suggests that the use of rosiglitazone to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular causes. This analysis included 42 randomized studies with over 40,000 total subjects aged 56 on average, and with an average baseline glycated hemoglobin level of 8.2%. The odds ratio for myocardial infarction was 1.43 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.98; P = 0.03) and for death from cardiovascular causes was 1.64 (95% CI, 0.98 to 2.74; P = 0.06). Despite the limitations of relying on the available literature, these results indicate a potential for serious adverse cardiovascular effects and should be considered before rosiglitazone is prescribed.",37AQKJ12TX943Q44HXXI2RZHR0DTT2
ACO8KWN80TC3P,"Rosiglitazone, a widely used treatment for type 2 diabetes, has been found to be associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death in an analysis of data from 42 randomized control trials. The odds ratio for myocardial infarction was 1.43 (95% CI, 1.03 to 1.98) and for death from cardiovascular causes was 1.64 (95% CI, 0.98 to 2.74). Time-to-event analysis could not be completed due to a lack of access to original source data. These findings suggest potential serious adverse cardiovascular effects from rosiglitazone and should be taken into account when prescribing it for treatment of type 2 diabetes.",37AQKJ12TX943Q44HXXI2RZHR0DTT2

With 194 deaths (4.1% of the patients), overall survival did not differ significantly between the two groups (hazard ratio for death in the exemestane - ovarian suppression group, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.51; P = 0.37). Selected adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were reported for 30.6% of the patients in the exemestane - ovarian suppression group and 29.4% of those in the tamoxifen - ovarian suppression group, with profiles similar to those for postmenopausal women",3ZQA3IO31BCNHENNJXR92BAZ0961OG

With 194 deaths (4.1% of the patients). In premenopausal women with hormone-receptor - positive early breast cancer, adjuvant treatment with exemestane plus ovarian suppression, as compared with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression, significantly reduced recurrence.In two phase 3 trials, we randomly assigned premenopausal women with hormone-receptor - positive early breast cancer to the aromatase inhibitor exemestane plus ovarian suppression or tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression for a period of 5 years. Suppression of ovarian estrogen production was achieved with the use of the gonadotropin-releasing-hormone agonist triptorelin, oophorectomy, or ovarian irradiation. The primary analysis combined data from 4690 patients in the two trials.",3ZQA3IO31BCNHENNJXR92BAZ0961OG
A2STM13VZOGVOR,"In this study, premenopausal women with hormone-receptor positive early breast cancer were randomly assigned to an adjuvant treatment of either exemestane plus ovarian suppression or tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression for five years. After a median follow-up 68 months, the disease-free survival rate at 5 years was 91.1% in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group, compared to 87.3% in the tamoxifen-ovarian suppression group. The rate of freedom from breast cancer at five years was 92.8% in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group compared to 88.8% in the tamoxifen-ovarian suppression group. Adverse events were mild and comparable between the two groups. In conclusion, these results indicate that exemestane plus ovarian suppression treatments significantly reduce recurrence rates of breast cancer among premenopausal patients, compared to tamoxifen and ovarian suppression treatments.",3ZQA3IO31BCNHENNJXR92BAZ0961OG

In 2010, the estimated mean level of global sodium consumption was 3.95 g per day, and regional mean levels ranged from 2.18 to 5.51 g per day. Globally, 1.65 million annual deaths from cardiovascular causes (95% uncertainty interval (confidence interval), 1.10 million to 2.22 million) were attributed to sodium intake above the reference level; 61.9% of these deaths occurred in men and 38.1% occurred in women.",32CXT5U14GO05JR5E4CXGRPWW108UK
A288UY7L4MKJSB,"In this modeling study, 1.65 million deaths from cardiovascular causes that occurred in 2010 were attributed to sodium consumption above a reference level of 2.0 g per day. High sodium intake increases blood pressure, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but the effects of sodium intake on global cardiovascular mortality are uncertain. In 2010, the estimated mean level of global sodium consumption was 3.95 g per day, and regional mean levels ranged from 2.18 to 5.51 g per day. Globally, 1.65 million annual deaths from cardiovascular causes (95% uncertainty interval (confidence interval), 1.10 million to 2.22 million) were attributed to sodium intake above the reference level; 61.9% of these deaths occurred in men and 38.1% occurred in women. These deaths accounted for nearly 1 of every 10 deaths from cardiovascular causes (9.5%). Four of every 5 deaths (84.3%) occurred in low - and middle-income countries, and 2 of every 5 deaths (40.4%) were premature (before 70 years of age). The rate of death from cardiovascular causes associated with sodium intake above the reference level was highest in the country of Georgia and lowest in Kenya. The persons are taking more bad form her health. nowadays the peoples making her health lowly. the persons are trying to take care of her life and health that the most important of basic persons life. We collected data from surveys on sodium intake as determined by urinary excretion and diet in persons from 66 countries (accounting for 74.1% of adults throughout the world), and we used these data to quantify the global consumption of sodium according to age, sex, and country. The effects of sodium on blood pressure, according to age, race, and the presence or absence of hypertension, were calculated from data in a new meta-analysis of 107 randomized interventions, and the effects of blood pressure on cardiovascular mortality, according to age, were calculated from a meta-analysis of cohorts. Cause-specific mortality was derived from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010. Using comparative risk assessment, we estimated the cardiovascular effects of current sodium intake, as compared with a reference intake of 2.0 g of sodium per day, according to age, sex, and country.",32CXT5U14GO05JR5E4CXGRPWW108UK
