NEJMoa0804748,"Comparison of Weight-Loss Diets with Different Compositions of Fat, Protein, and Carbohydrates

The possible advantage for weight loss of a diet that emphasizes protein , fat , or carbohydrates has not been established , and there are few studies that extend beyond 1 year .

We randomly assigned 811 overweight adults to one of four diets ; the targeted percentages of energy derived from fat , protein , and carbohydrates in the four diets were 20 , 15 , and 65 % ; 20 , 25 , and 55 % ; 40 , 15 , and 45 % ; and 40 , 25 , and 35 % . The diets consisted of similar foods and met guidelines for cardiovascular health . The participants were offered group and individual instructional sessions for 2 years . The primary outcome was the change in body weight after 2 years in two-by-two factorial comparisons of low fat versus high fat and average protein versus high protein and in the comparison of highest and lowest carbohydrate content .

At 6 months , participants assigned to each diet had lost an average of 6 kg , which represented 7 % of their initial weight ; they began to regain weight after 12 months . By 2 years , weight loss remained similar in those who were assigned to a diet with 15 % protein and those assigned to a diet with 25 % protein ( 3.0 and 3.6 kg , respectively ) ; in those assigned to a diet with 20 % fat and those assigned to a diet with 40 % fat ( 3.3 kg for both groups ) ; and in those assigned to a diet with 65 % carbohydrates and those assigned to a diet with 35 % carbohydrates ( 2.9 and 3.4 kg , respectively ) ( P ) 0.20 for all comparisons ) . Among the 80 % of participants who completed the trial , the average weight loss was 4 kg ; 14 to 15 % of the participants had a reduction of at least 10 % of their initial body weight . Satiety , hunger , satisfaction with the diet , and attendance at group sessions were similar for all diets ; attendance was strongly associated with weight loss ( 0.2 kg per session attended ) . The diets improved lipid-related risk factors and fasting insulin levels .

NEJMoa1000727,"Effect of Screening Mammography on Breast-Cancer Mortality in Norway

A challenge in quantifying the effect of screening mammography on breast-cancer mortality is to provide valid comparison groups . The use of historical control subjects does not take into account chronologic trends associated with advances in breast-cancer awareness and treatment .

The Norwegian breast-cancer screening program was started in 1996 and expanded geographically during the subsequent 9 years . Women between the ages of 50 and 69 years were offered screening mammography every 2 years . We compared the incidence-based rates of death from breast cancer in four groups : two groups of women who from 1996 through 2005 were living in counties with screening ( screening group ) or without screening ( nonscreening group ) ; and two historical-comparison groups that from 1986 through 1995 mirrored the current groups .

We analyzed data from 40,075 women with breast cancer . The rate of death was reduced by 7.2 deaths per 100,000 person-years in the screening group as compared with the historical screening group ( rate ratio , 0.72 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.63 to 0.81 ) and by 4.8 deaths per 100,000 person-years in the nonscreening group as compared with the historical nonscreening group ( rate ratio , 0.82 ; 95 % CI , 0.71 to 0.93 ; P ( 0.001 for both comparisons ) , for a relative reduction in mortality of 10 % in the screening group ( P = 0.13 ) . Thus , the difference in the reduction in mortality between the current and historical groups that could be attributed to screening alone was 2.4 deaths per 100,000 person-years , or a third of the total reduction of 7.2 deaths .

The availability of screening mammography was associated with a reduction in the rate of death from breast cancer , but the screening itself accounted for only about a third of the total reduction . ( Funded by the Cancer Registry of Norway and the Research Council of Norway . )

NEJMoa1102287,"First Results of Phase 3 Trial of RTS,S/AS01 Malaria Vaccine in African Children

An ongoing phase 3 study of the efficacy , safety , and immunogenicity of candidate malaria vaccine RTS , S\/AS01 is being conducted in seven African countries .

From March 2009 through January 2011 , we enrolled 15,460 children in two age categories -- 6 to 12 weeks of age and 5 to 17 months of age -- for vaccination with either RTS , S\/AS01 or a non-malaria comparator vaccine . The primary end point of the analysis was vaccine efficacy against clinical malaria during the 12 months after vaccination in the first 6000 children 5 to 17 months of age at enrollment who received all three doses of vaccine according to protocol . After 250 children had an episode of severe malaria , we evaluated vaccine efficacy against severe malaria in both age categories .

In the 14 months after the first dose of vaccine , the incidence of first episodes of clinical malaria in the first 6000 children in the older age category was 0.32 episodes per person-year in the RTS , S\/AS01 group and 0.55 episodes per person-year in the control group , for an efficacy of 50.4 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 45.8 to 54.6 ) in the intention-to-treat population and 55.8 % ( 97.5 % CI , 50.6 to 60.4 ) in the per-protocol population . Vaccine efficacy against severe malaria was 45.1 % ( 95 % CI , 23.8 to 60.5 ) in the intention-to-treat population and 47.3 % ( 95 % CI , 22.4 to 64.2 ) in the per-protocol population . Vaccine efficacy against severe malaria in the combined age categories was 34.8 % ( 95 % CI , 16.2 to 49.2 ) in the per-protocol population during an average follow-up of 11 months . Serious adverse events occurred with a similar frequency in the two study groups . Among children in the older age category , the rate of generalized convulsive seizures after RTS , S\/AS01 vaccination was 1.04 per 1000 doses ( 95 % CI , 0.62 to 1.64 ) .

The RTS , S\/AS01 vaccine provided protection against both clinical and severe malaria in African children .

NEJMoa1003833,"Azithromycin and the Risk of Cardiovascular Death

Although several macrolide antibiotics are proarrhythmic and associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death , azithromycin is thought to have minimal cardiotoxicity . However , published reports of arrhythmias suggest that azithromycin may increase the risk of cardiovascular death .

We studied a Tennessee Medicaid cohort designed to detect an increased risk of death related to short-term cardiac effects of medication , excluding patients with serious noncardiovascular illness and person-time during and shortly after hospitalization . The cohort included patients who took azithromycin ( 347,795 prescriptions ) , propensity-score -- matched persons who took no antibiotics ( 1,391,180 control periods ) , and patients who took amoxicillin ( 1,348,672 prescriptions ) , ciprofloxacin ( 264,626 prescriptions ) , or levofloxacin ( 193,906 prescriptions ) .

During 5 days of therapy , patients taking azithromycin , as compared with those who took no antibiotics , had an increased risk of cardiovascular death ( hazard ratio , 2.88 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.79 to 4.63 ; P ( 0.001 ) and death from any cause ( hazard ratio , 1.85 ; 95 % CI , 1.25 to 2.75 ; P = 0.002 ) . Patients who took amoxicillin had no increase in the risk of death during this period . Relative to amoxicillin , azithromycin was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death ( hazard ratio , 2.49 ; 95 % CI , 1.38 to 4.50 ; P = 0.002 ) and death from any cause ( hazard ratio , 2.02 ; 95 % CI , 1.24 to 3.30 ; P = 0.005 ) , with an estimated 47 additional cardiovascular deaths per 1 million courses ; patients in the highest decile of risk for cardiovascular disease had an estimated 245 additional cardiovascular deaths per 1 million courses . The risk of cardiovascular death was significantly greater with azithromycin than with ciprofloxacin but did not differ significantly from that with levofloxacin .

During 5 days of azithromycin therapy , there was a small absolute increase in cardiovascular deaths , which was most pronounced among patients with a high baseline risk of cardiovascular disease .

NEJMoa1003114,"Effect of Sibutramine on Cardiovascular Outcomes in Overweight and Obese Subjects

The long-term effects of sibutramine treatment on the rates of cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death among subjects at high cardiovascular risk have not been established .

We enrolled in our study 10,744 overweight or obese subjects , 55 years of age or older , with preexisting cardiovascular disease , type 2 diabetes mellitus , or both to assess the cardiovascular consequences of weight management with and without sibutramine in subjects at high risk for cardiovascular events . All the subjects received sibutramine in addition to participating in a weight-management program during a 6-week , single-blind , lead-in period , after which 9804 subjects underwent random assignment in a double-blind fashion to sibutramine ( 4906 subjects ) or placebo ( 4898 subjects ) . The primary end point was the time from randomization to the first occurrence of a primary outcome event ( nonfatal myocardial infarction , nonfatal stroke , resuscitation after cardiac arrest , or cardiovascular death ) .

The mean duration of treatment was 3.4 years . The mean weight loss during the lead-in period was 2.6 kg ; after randomization , the subjects in the sibutramine group achieved and maintained further weight reduction ( mean , 1.7 kg ) . The mean blood pressure decreased in both groups , with greater reductions in the placebo group than in the sibutramine group ( mean difference , 1.2 \/ 1.4 mm Hg ) . The risk of a primary outcome event was 11.4 % in the sibutramine group as compared with 10.0 % in the placebo group ( hazard ratio , 1.16 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.03 to 1.31 ; P = 0.02 ) . The rates of nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke were 4.1 % and 2.6 % in the sibutramine group and 3.2 % and 1.9 % in the placebo group , respectively ( hazard ratio for nonfatal myocardial infarction , 1.28 ; 95 % CI , 1.04 to 1.57 ; P = 0.02 ; hazard ratio for nonfatal stroke , 1.36 ; 95 % CI , 1.04 to 1.77 ; P = 0.03 ) . The rates of cardiovascular death and death from any cause were not increased .

Subjects with preexisting cardiovascular conditions who were receiving long-term sibutramine treatment had an increased risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke but not of cardiovascular death or death from any cause .

NEJMoa1103507,"Exemestane for Breast-Cancer Prevention in Postmenopausal Women

Tamoxifen and raloxifene have limited patient acceptance for primary prevention of breast cancer . Aromatase inhibitors prevent more contralateral breast cancers and cause fewer side effects than tamoxifen in patients with early-stage breast cancer .

In a randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind trial of exemestane designed to detect a 65 % relative reduction in invasive breast cancer , eligible postmenopausal women 35 years of age or older had at least one of the following risk factors : 60 years of age or older ; Gail 5-year risk score greater than 1.66 % ( chances in 100 of invasive breast cancer developing within 5 years ) ; prior atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ ; or ductal carcinoma in situ with mastectomy . Toxic effects and health-related and menopause-specific qualities of life were measured .

A total of 4560 women for whom the median age was 62.5 years and the median Gail risk score was 2.3 % were randomly assigned to either exemestane or placebo . At a median follow-up of 35 months , 11 invasive breast cancers were detected in those given exemestane and in 32 of those given placebo , with a 65 % relative reduction in the annual incidence of invasive breast cancer ( 0.19 % vs. 0.55 % ; hazard ratio , 0.35 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.18 to 0.70 ; P = 0.002 ) . The annual incidence of invasive plus noninvasive ( ductal carcinoma in situ ) breast cancers was 0.35 % on exemestane and 0.77 % on placebo ( hazard ratio , 0.47 ; 95 % CI , 0.27 to 0.79 ; P = 0.004 ) . Adverse events occurred in 88 % of the exemestane group and 85 % of the placebo group ( P = 0.003 ) , with no significant differences between the two groups in terms of skeletal fractures , cardiovascular events , other cancers , or treatment-related deaths . Minimal quality-of-life differences were observed .

Exemestane significantly reduced invasive breast cancers in postmenopausal women who were at moderately increased risk for breast cancer . During a median follow-up period of 3 years , exemestane was associated with no serious toxic effects and only minimal changes in health-related quality of life .

NEJMoa1206809,"Effect of Three Decades of Screening Mammography on Breast-Cancer Incidence

To reduce mortality , screening must detect life-threatening disease at an earlier , more curable stage . Effective cancer-screening programs therefore both increase the incidence of cancer detected at an early stage and decrease the incidence of cancer presenting at a late stage .

We used Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results data to examine trends from 1976 through 2008 in the incidence of early-stage breast cancer ( ductal carcinoma in situ and localized disease ) and late-stage breast cancer ( regional and distant disease ) among women 40 years of age or older .

The introduction of screening mammography in the United States has been associated with a doubling in the number of cases of early-stage breast cancer that are detected each year , from 112 to 234 cases per 100,000 women -- an absolute increase of 122 cases per 100,000 women . Concomitantly , the rate at which women present with late-stage cancer has decreased by 8 % , from 102 to 94 cases per 100,000 women -- an absolute decrease of 8 cases per 100,000 women . With the assumption of a constant underlying disease burden , only 8 of the 122 additional early-stage cancers diagnosed were expected to progress to advanced disease . After excluding the transient excess incidence associated with hormone-replacement therapy and adjusting for trends in the incidence of breast cancer among women younger than 40 years of age , we estimated that breast cancer was overdiagnosed ( i.e. , tumors were detected on screening that would never have led to clinical symptoms ) in 1.3 million U.S. women in the past 30 years . We estimated that in 2008 , breast cancer was overdiagnosed in more than 70,000 women ; this accounted for 31 % of all breast cancers diagnosed .

Despite substantial increases in the number of cases of early-stage breast cancer detected , screening mammography has only marginally reduced the rate at which women present with advanced cancer . Although it is not certain which women have been affected , the imbalance suggests that there is substantial overdiagnosis , accounting for nearly a third of all newly diagnosed breast cancers , and that screening is having , at best , only a small effect on the rate of death from breast cancer .

NEJMoa1200303,"Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet

Observational cohort studies and a secondary prevention trial have shown an inverse association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and cardiovascular risk . We conducted a randomized trial of this diet pattern for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events .

In a multicenter trial in Spain , we randomly assigned participants who were at high cardiovascular risk , but with no cardiovascular disease at enrollment , to one of three diets : a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil , a Mediterranean diet supplemented with mixed nuts , or a control diet ( advice to reduce dietary fat ) . Participants received quarterly individual and group educational sessions and , depending on group assignment , free provision of extra-virgin olive oil , mixed nuts , or small nonfood gifts . The primary end point was the rate of major cardiovascular events ( myocardial infarction , stroke , or death from cardiovascular causes ) . On the basis of the results of an interim analysis , the trial was stopped after a median follow-up of 4.8 years .

A total of 7447 persons were enrolled ( age range , 55 to 80 years ) ; 57 % were women . The two Mediterranean-diet groups had good adherence to the intervention , according to self-reported intake and biomarker analyses . A primary end-point event occurred in 288 participants . The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios were 0.70 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.54 to 0.92 ) and 0.72 ( 95 % CI , 0.54 to 0.96 ) for the group assigned to a Mediterranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil ( 96 events ) and the group assigned to a Mediterranean diet with nuts ( 83 events ) , respectively , versus the control group ( 109 events ) . No diet-related adverse effects were reported .

NEJMoa1200850,"Waning Protection after Fifth Dose of Acellular Pertussis Vaccine in Children

In the United States , children receive five doses of diphtheria , tetanus , and acellular pertussis ( DTaP ) vaccine before 7 years of age . The duration of protection after five doses of DTaP is unknown .

We assessed the risk of pertussis in children in California relative to the time since the fifth dose of DTaP from 2006 to 2011 . This period included a large outbreak in 2010 . We conducted a case -- control study involving members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California who were vaccinated with DTaP at 47 to 84 months of age . We compared children with pertussis confirmed by a positive polymerase-chain-reaction ( PCR ) assay with two sets of controls : those who were PCR-negative for pertussis and closely matched controls from the general population of health-plan members . We used logistic regression to examine the risk of pertussis in relation to the duration of time since the fifth DTaP dose . Children who received whole-cell pertussis vaccine during infancy or who received any pertussis-containing vaccine after their fifth dose of DTaP were excluded .

We compared 277 children , 4 to 12 years of age , who were PCR-positive for pertussis with 3318 PCR-negative controls and 6086 matched controls . PCR-positive children were more likely to have received the fifth DTaP dose earlier than PCR-negative controls ( P ( 0.001 ) or matched controls ( P = 0.005 ) . Comparison with PCR-negative controls yielded an odds ratio of 1.42 ( 95 % confidence interval , 1.21 to 1.66 ) , indicating that after the fifth dose of DTaP , the odds of acquiring pertussis increased by an average of 42 % per year .

NEJMoa1014296,"Changes in Diet and Lifestyle and Long-Term Weight Gain in Women and Men

Specific dietary and other lifestyle behaviors may affect the success of the straightforward-sounding strategy `` eat less and exercise more '' for preventing long-term weight gain .

We performed prospective investigations involving three separate cohorts that included 120,877 U.S. women and men who were free of chronic diseases and not obese at baseline , with follow-up periods from 1986 to 2006 , 1991 to 2003 , and 1986 to 2006 . The relationships between changes in lifestyle factors and weight change were evaluated at 4-year intervals , with multivariable adjustments made for age , baseline body-mass index for each period , and all lifestyle factors simultaneously . Cohort-specific and sex-specific results were similar and were pooled with the use of an inverse-variance -- weighted meta-analysis .

Within each 4-year period , participants gained an average of 3.35 lb ( 5th to 95th percentile , − 4.1 to 12.4 ) . On the basis of increased daily servings of individual dietary components , 4-year weight change was most strongly associated with the intake of potato chips ( 1.69 lb ) , potatoes ( 1.28 lb ) , sugar-sweetened beverages ( 1.00 lb ) , unprocessed red meats ( 0.95 lb ) , and processed meats ( 0.93 lb ) and was inversely associated with the intake of vegetables ( − 0.22 lb ) , whole grains ( − 0.37 lb ) , fruits ( − 0.49 lb ) , nuts ( − 0.57 lb ) , and yogurt ( − 0.82 lb ) ( P ≤ 0.005 for each comparison ) . Aggregate dietary changes were associated with substantial differences in weight change ( 3.93 lb across quintiles of dietary change ) . Other lifestyle factors were also independently associated with weight change ( P ( 0.001 ) , including physical activity ( − 1.76 lb across quintiles ) ; alcohol use ( 0.41 lb per drink per day ) , smoking ( new quitters , 5.17 lb ; former smokers , 0.14 lb ) , sleep ( more weight gain with ( 6 or ) 8 hours of sleep ) , and television watching ( 0.31 lb per hour per day ) .

NEJMoa021134,"A Population-Based Study of Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccination and Autism

It has been suggested that vaccination against measles , mumps , and rubella ( MMR ) is a cause of autism .

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all children born in Denmark from January 1991 through December 1998 . The cohort was selected on the basis of data from the Danish Civil Registration System , which assigns a unique identification number to every live-born infant and new resident in Denmark . MMR-vaccination status was obtained from the Danish National Board of Health . Information on the children 's autism status was obtained from the Danish Psychiatric Central Register , which contains information on all diagnoses received by patients in psychiatric hospitals and outpatient clinics in Denmark . We obtained information on potential confounders from the Danish Medical Birth Registry , the National Hospital Registry , and Statistics Denmark .

Of the 537,303 children in the cohort ( representing 2,129,864 person-years ) , 440,655 ( 82.0 percent ) had received the MMR vaccine . We identified 316 children with a diagnosis of autistic disorder and 422 with a diagnosis of other autistic-spectrum disorders . After adjustment for potential confounders , the relative risk of autistic disorder in the group of vaccinated children , as compared with the unvaccinated group , was 0.92 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0.68 to 1.24 ) , and the relative risk of another autistic-spectrum disorder was 0.83 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0.65 to 1.07 ) . There was no association between the age at the time of vaccination , the time since vaccination , or the date of vaccination and the development of autistic disorder .

This study provides strong evidence against the hypothesis that MMR vaccination causes autism .

NEJMoa0907413,"Response to a Monovalent 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) Vaccine

A novel 2009 influenza A ( H1N1 ) virus is responsible for the first influenza pandemic in 41 years . A safe and effective vaccine is needed . A randomized , observer-blind , parallel-group trial evaluating two doses of an inactivated , split-virus 2009 H1N1 vaccine in healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 64 years is ongoing at a single site in Australia .

We evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine after each of two scheduled doses , administered 21 days apart . A total of 240 subjects , equally divided into two age groups ( ( 50 years and ≥ 50 years ) , were enrolled and underwent randomization to receive either 15 μg or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen by intramuscular injection . We measured antibody titers using hemagglutination-inhibition and microneutralization assays at baseline and 21 days after vaccination . The coprimary immunogenicity end points were the proportion of subjects with antibody titers of 1:40 or more on hemagglutination-inhibition assay , the proportion of subjects with either seroconversion or a significant increase in antibody titer , and the factor increase in the geometric mean titer .

By day 21 after the first dose , antibody titers of 1:40 or more were observed in 114 of 120 subjects ( 95.0 % ) who received the 15-μg dose and in 106 of 119 subjects ( 89.1 % ) who received the 30-μg dose . A similar result was observed after the second dose of vaccine . No deaths , serious adverse events , or adverse events of special interest were reported . Local discomfort ( e.g. , injection-site tenderness or pain ) was reported by 56.3 % of subjects , and systemic symptoms ( e.g. , headache ) by 53.8 % of subjects after each dose . Nearly all events were mild to moderate in intensity .

NEJMoa1112010,"Association of Coffee Drinking with Total and Cause-Specific Mortality

Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages , but the association between coffee consumption and the risk of death remains unclear .

We examined the association of coffee drinking with subsequent total and cause-specific mortality among 229,119 men and 173,141 women in the National Institutes of Health -- AARP Diet and Health Study who were 50 to 71 years of age at baseline . Participants with cancer , heart disease , and stroke were excluded . Coffee consumption was assessed once at baseline .

During 5,148,760 person-years of follow-up between 1995 and 2008 , a total of 33,731 men and 18,784 women died . In age-adjusted models , the risk of death was increased among coffee drinkers . However , coffee drinkers were also more likely to smoke , and , after adjustment for tobacco-smoking status and other potential confounders , there was a significant inverse association between coffee consumption and mortality . Adjusted hazard ratios for death among men who drank coffee as compared with those who did not were as follows : 0.99 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.95 to 1.04 ) for drinking less than 1 cup per day , 0.94 ( 95 % CI , 0.90 to 0.99 ) for 1 cup , 0.90 ( 95 % CI , 0.86 to 0.93 ) for 2 or 3 cups , 0.88 ( 95 % CI , 0.84 to 0.93 ) for 4 or 5 cups , and 0.90 ( 95 % CI , 0.85 to 0.96 ) for 6 or more cups of coffee per day ( P ( 0.001 for trend ) ; the respective hazard ratios among women were 1.01 ( 95 % CI , 0.96 to 1.07 ) , 0.95 ( 95 % CI , 0.90 to 1.01 ) , 0.87 ( 95 % CI , 0.83 to 0.92 ) , 0.84 ( 95 % CI , 0.79 to 0.90 ) , and 0.85 ( 95 % CI , 0.78 to 0.93 ) ( P ( 0.001 for trend ) . Inverse associations were observed for deaths due to heart disease , respiratory disease , stroke , injuries and accidents , diabetes , and infections , but not for deaths due to cancer . Results were similar in subgroups , including persons who had never smoked and persons who reported very good to excellent health at baseline .

In this large prospective study , coffee consumption was inversely associated with total and cause-specific mortality .

NEJMoa072761,"Effect of Rosiglitazone on the Risk of Myocardial Infarction and Death from Cardiovascular Causes

Rosiglitazone is widely used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus , but its effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined .

We conducted searches of the published literature , the Web site of the Food and Drug Administration , and a clinical-trials registry maintained by the drug manufacturer ( GlaxoSmithKline ) . Criteria for inclusion in our meta-analysis included a study duration of more than 24 weeks , the use of a randomized control group not receiving rosiglitazone , and the availability of outcome data for myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular causes . Of 116 potentially relevant studies , 42 trials met the inclusion criteria . We tabulated all occurrences of myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular causes .

Data were combined by means of a fixed-effects model . In the 42 trials , the mean age of the subjects was approximately 56 years , and the mean baseline glycated hemoglobin level was approximately 8.2 % . In the rosiglitazone group , as compared with the control group , the odds ratio for myocardial infarction was 1.43 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.03 to 1.98 ; P = 0.03 ) , and the odds ratio for death from cardiovascular causes was 1.64 ( 95 % CI , 0.98 to 2.74 ; P = 0.06 ) .

Rosiglitazone was associated with a significant increase in the risk of myocardial infarction and with an increase in the risk of death from cardiovascular causes that had borderline significance . Our study was limited by a lack of access to original source data , which would have enabled time-to-event analysis . Despite these limitations , patients and providers should consider the potential for serious adverse cardiovascular effects of treatment with rosiglitazone for type 2 diabetes .

NEJMoa1404037,"Adjuvant Exemestane with Ovarian Suppression in Premenopausal Breast Cancer

Adjuvant therapy with an aromatase inhibitor improves outcomes , as compared with tamoxifen , in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor -- positive breast cancer .

In two phase 3 trials , we randomly assigned premenopausal women with hormone-receptor -- positive early breast cancer to the aromatase inhibitor exemestane plus ovarian suppression or tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression for a period of 5 years . Suppression of ovarian estrogen production was achieved with the use of the gonadotropin-releasing-hormone agonist triptorelin , oophorectomy , or ovarian irradiation . The primary analysis combined data from 4690 patients in the two trials .

After a median follow-up of 68 months , disease-free survival at 5 years was 91.1 % in the exemestane -- ovarian suppression group and 87.3 % in the tamoxifen -- ovarian suppression group ( hazard ratio for disease recurrence , second invasive cancer , or death , 0.72 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.60 to 0.85 ; P ( 0.001 ) . The rate of freedom from breast cancer at 5 years was 92.8 % in the exemestane -- ovarian suppression group , as compared with 88.8 % in the tamoxifen -- ovarian suppression group ( hazard ratio for recurrence , 0.66 ; 95 % CI , 0.55 to 0.80 ; P ( 0.001 ) . With 194 deaths ( 4.1 % of the patients ) , overall survival did not differ significantly between the two groups ( hazard ratio for death in the exemestane -- ovarian suppression group , 1.14 ; 95 % CI , 0.86 to 1.51 ; P = 0.37 ) . Selected adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were reported for 30.6 % of the patients in the exemestane -- ovarian suppression group and 29.4 % of those in the tamoxifen -- ovarian suppression group , with profiles similar to those for postmenopausal women .

In premenopausal women with hormone-receptor -- positive early breast cancer , adjuvant treatment with exemestane plus ovarian suppression , as compared with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression , significantly reduced recurrence .

NEJMoa1304127,"Global Sodium Consumption and Death from Cardiovascular Causes

High sodium intake increases blood pressure , a risk factor for cardiovascular disease , but the effects of sodium intake on global cardiovascular mortality are uncertain .

We collected data from surveys on sodium intake as determined by urinary excretion and diet in persons from 66 countries ( accounting for 74.1 % of adults throughout the world ) , and we used these data to quantify the global consumption of sodium according to age , sex , and country . The effects of sodium on blood pressure , according to age , race , and the presence or absence of hypertension , were calculated from data in a new meta-analysis of 107 randomized interventions , and the effects of blood pressure on cardiovascular mortality , according to age , were calculated from a meta-analysis of cohorts . Cause-specific mortality was derived from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 . Using comparative risk assessment , we estimated the cardiovascular effects of current sodium intake , as compared with a reference intake of 2.0 g of sodium per day , according to age , sex , and country .

In 2010 , the estimated mean level of global sodium consumption was 3.95 g per day , and regional mean levels ranged from 2.18 to 5.51 g per day . Globally , 1.65 million annual deaths from cardiovascular causes ( 95 % uncertainty interval ( confidence interval ) , 1.10 million to 2.22 million ) were attributed to sodium intake above the reference level ; 61.9 % of these deaths occurred in men and 38.1 % occurred in women . These deaths accounted for nearly 1 of every 10 deaths from cardiovascular causes ( 9.5 % ) . Four of every 5 deaths ( 84.3 % ) occurred in low - and middle-income countries , and 2 of every 5 deaths ( 40.4 % ) were premature ( before 70 years of age ) . The rate of death from cardiovascular causes associated with sodium intake above the reference level was highest in the country of Georgia and lowest in Kenya .

In this modeling study , 1.65 million deaths from cardiovascular causes that occurred in 2010 were attributed to sodium consumption above a reference level of 2.0 g per day . ( Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation . )
