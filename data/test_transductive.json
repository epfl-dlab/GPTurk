Children in the United States receive five doses of DTaP before the age of seven, but the duration of protection beyond this is unknown. Researchers conducted a case-control study in California, comparing children with confirmed pertussis to matched controls who had tested negative for the disease. Results showed that children who had received their fifth DTaP dose earlier were more likely to test positive for pertussis than those who had received the vaccine more recently, indicating that protection waned during the five years after the fifth dose. The study found that the odds of acquiring pertussis increased by an average of 42% per year after the fifth dose of DTaP.",

After about 35 months a follow up was done. 11 breast cancers were detected in women who used Exemestane and 32 in those given the placebo. This study showed that by giving women who previously had breast cancer the drug Exemestane had a 65% relative reduction in invasive breast cancer. Exemestane really reduced the incidence of recurring breast cancer in post menopausal women. Especially when they were at an increased risk of recurring breast cancer. After a follow up with these women 3 years later, it was found that Exemestane also had no serious toxic side effects, made no difference in incidences of heart attacks or other cardiovascular events and also helped the women maintain their quality of life after breast cancer. It would seem that this drug is very good at preventing a return of breast cancer for many women who have experienced it before. ",

The results found that in 2010, the global mean level of sodium consumption was 3.95 grams per day, with regional mean levels ranging from 2.18 grams to 5.51 grams. Using comparative risk assessment, the research estimated that 1.65 million annual deaths from cardiovascular causes were attributed to a higher consumption of sodium than the recommended level of 2.0 grams per day.",

The results showed that specific dietary and lifestyle factors are independently associated with long-term weight gain, with a substantial aggregate effect.
