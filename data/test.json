The study was conducted through a randomised trial of the diet pattern for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events. Participants were at high cardiovascular risk but had no cardiovascular disease at enrolment, and were randomly assigned to one of three diets. The primary end point was the rate of major cardiovascular events, and the results showed that the two Mediterranean-diet groups had good adherence to the intervention, and no diet-related adverse effects were reported. The study concludes that a Mediterranean diet supplemented with olive oil or nuts can help prevent cardiovascular disease.",

While both groups experienced a reduction in blood pressure, the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke was higher in the sibutramine group.

The number of cases detected has almost doubled from 112 to 234 per 100k women there. In contrast, there has been an 8% reduction in the prevalence of cancer cases presenting as late-stage cases. The study claims that increased screening has led to overdiagnosis, including tumors detected during screening that would not have led to clinical symptoms, in 1.3 million US women over the past 30 years. This figure amounted to 31% of all breast cancer diagnoses in 2008, with screening having little effect on the breast cancer fatality rate.",

In the 42 trials the mean age was approximately 56 years old and the baseline glycated hemoglobin level was 8.2%. The rosiglitazone grup as compared to the control group the odds ratio for mycardio infarction was 1.43 and the odds ratio for death from cardiovascular causes was 1.64. Rosiglilazone was associated with a significant increase in the risk of myocardial infarction and with an increase in the risk of death from cardiovascular causes that had borderline significance. Despite limitations the serious adverse effects of treatment with rosiglitazone for type 2 diabetes should be considered. ",

The fifth dose is given to children before the age of seven and while it is more than 90% effective at preventing whooping cough during the first year following the vaccination, its effectiveness then declines by an average of 42% each year. The study was conducted by researchers from Kaiser Permanente and the California Department of Public Health and indicates that additional booster vaccinations may be needed to maintain adequate protection against the disease. The findings may also help explain the resurgence of whooping cough in the US in recent years.",

The remaining two-thirds of the reduction are due to advances in breast cancer awareness and treatment. The study analysed data from 40,075 women, comparing the incidence-based rates of death from breast cancer in four groups; two groups of women who from 1996 through 2005 were living in counties with screening or without screening, and two historical-comparison groups that from 1986 through 1995 mirrored the current groups.

After this period, 9804 subjects underwent random assignment to sibutramine or placebo in a double-blind fashion. The primary endpoint was the time to the first occurrence of a primary outcome event. The results showed that the risk of a primary outcome event was higher in the sibutramine group than in the placebo group, with an increased risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke but no increased risk of cardiovascular death or death from any cause.",

The annual incidence of invasive plus noninvasive breast cancers was also reduced by 47% in the exemestane group. Adverse events occurred in 88% of the exemestane group and 85% of the placebo group, with no significant differences between the two groups in terms of skeletal fractures, cardiovascular events, other cancers, or treatment-related deaths.
