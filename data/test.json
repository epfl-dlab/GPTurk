Over a four-year interval, participants gained an average of 3.35 lb, with diet factors having the most significant effect on weight gain. The study found that the consumption of individual dietary components such as potato chips, potatoes, sugar-sweetened beverages, unprocessed red meat, and processed meats were the most strongly associated with weight gain. In contrast, intake of vegetables, whole grains, fruit, nuts, and yogurt were inversely associated with weight gain.

The Norwegian breast cancer screening program started and grew, leading to women from 50-69 years old getting access to mammogram screenings every two years. They compared four groups made up of 40,075 women total with breast cancer. Two groups were from 1996-2005. One group received screening and one did not. The other two groups were from 1986 through 1995 and again, one received screening and the other didn't. The rate of death decreased by 7.2 deaths per 100,000 person-years in the 1996-2005 group compared to the 1986-1995 group.

    "text":"A study that looked at the risk of pertussis in children found that protection against pertussis decreased in the five years following the fifth dose of the DTap vaccine, which is the typical dosage.  The study, done in California on members of Kaiser Permanente Nothern California, included a group of children who were vaccinated approximately between ages 4 and 7; children who were vaccinated as infants or those who had received more than five doses were excluded.  A group of children that had pertussis was compared against two control groups.  The polymerase-charin-reaction (PRC) status of the children was also taken into account.  The risk of pertussis as it related to time that had elapsed since the fifth DTaP dose was then examined.  Those calculations showed that after the fifth dose of DTap, it became increasingly likely to acquire pertussis: the risk went up by 42% per year, on average.  ",

While traditionally it has been thought that the drug has minimal cardiotoxicity, the study found an increased risk\u00a0during five\u00a0days of therapy, compared to those who took no antibiotics, with an estimated 47 additional cardiovascular deaths per 1 million courses. It was also noted that the risk was greatest among patients with a high baseline risk of cardiovascular disease.\n",

    "text":"A recent study has highlighted the potential risk of cardiovascular death associated with the antibiotic azithromycin. Researchers studied a cohort of Tennessee Medicaid patients, including those who had taken azithromycin, amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin. Patients taking azithromycin had a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular death compared to those who took no antibiotics, with an estimated 47 additional cardiovascular deaths per 1 million courses. Furthermore, the risk of cardiovascular death was significantly greater with azithromycin than with ciprofloxacin. Although azithromycin is considered to have minimal cardiotoxicity, this study suggests it may increase the risk of cardiovascular death, particularly for patients with a high baseline risk of cardiovascular disease.",

The study, which combined data from randomised control groups and outcome data for myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular causes, revealed the odds ratio for myocardial infarction was 1.43 and the odds ratio for death from cardiovascular causes was 1.64. Although the increase in risk of death was only borderline significant, patients and providers should consider the potential for serious adverse cardiovascular effects. The study was limited by a lack of access to original source data.",

The drug was tested in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on patients over 35 with risk factors such as 60 years of age or older, prior atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia or ductal carcinoma in situ. A total of 4560 women were tested, with 11 invasive breast cancers detected in the exemestane group and 32 in the placebo group. The drug had minimal changes in the quality of life and no serious side\u00a0effects. Exemestane was found to be more effective than tamoxifen and raloxifene.",

Researchers enrolled 10,744 participants aged 55 years or older, with preexisting cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or both, to assess how weight management with or without sibutramine affects cardiovascular events among those at high risk. Subjects were given sibutramine during a 6-week single-blind period and were randomly assigned in a double-blinded manner to sibutramine or placebo, with a mean treatment duration of 3.4 years. The sibutramine group lost more weight, but had a higher risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke than the placebo group. The risk of cardiovascular death or death from any cause was not increased.",

The respective hazard ratios among women were 1.01, 0.95, 0.87, 0.84, and 0.85.
