The challenge of accurately quantifying this effect is due to the need for valid comparison groups that take into account trends associated with advances in breast-cancer awareness and treatment.

The study examined the association of coffee drinking with subsequent total and cause-specific mortality. Initially, it was found that the risk increased among coffee drinkers. However, coffee drinkers were also more likely to smoke; therefore, after adjustment for tobacco-smoking status and other potential confounders, there was a significant inverse association between coffee consumption and mortality. Specifically, men who drank less than 1 cup a day had a .99 risk compared to  .88 for men who drank 4 or 5 cups a day. The respective hazard ratios for women were 1.01 for those who drank less than 1 cup a day, decreasing to .84 for those who drank 4 or 5 cups a day.

A Norwegian study analysed data from over 40,000 women and compared the incidence-based rates of death from breast cancer in four groups: two groups of women living in counties with screening (screening group) or without screening (non-screening group) between 1996 and 2005, and two historical-comparison groups that mirrored the current groups from 1986-1995. The study found that the rate of death was reduced by 7.2 deaths per 100,000 person-years in the screening group as compared to the historical screening group and by 4.8 deaths per 100,000 person-years in the non-screening group as compared to the historical non-screening group.

The study examined the association of coffee drinking with total and cause-specific mortality among 229,119 men and 173,141 women in the National Institutes of Health - AARP Diet and Health Study who were aged 50 to 71 years at baseline. During 5,148,760 person-years of follow-up between 1995 and 2008, a total of 33,731 men and 18,784 women died. In age-adjusted models, the risk of death was increased among coffee drinkers, however, after adjustment for tobacco-smoking status and other potential confounders, there was a significant inverse association between coffee consumption and mortality. Inverse associations were observed for deaths due to heart disease, respiratory disease, stroke, injuries and accidents, diabetes, and infections, but not for deaths due to cancer.",

After a median follow-up of 68 months, disease-free survival at five years was 91.1% in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group and 87.3% in the tamoxifen-ovarian suppression group. However, rates of freedom from breast cancer at five years were 92.8% in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group, compared to 88.8% in the tamoxifen-ovarian suppression group. Overall survival did not differ significantly between the two groups, with 194 deaths reported in 4.1% of the patients.\u00a0",

Children aged between six weeks and 17 months were vaccinated either with RTS,S\/AS01 or a non-malaria comparator vaccine and efficacy against clinical and severe malaria was monitored after 14 months. Within the group aged five to 17 months, RTS,S\/AS01 vaccination showed 50.4% efficacy against clinical malaria and 45.1% efficacy against severe malaria. RTS,S\/AS01 vaccination demonstrated no significant safety issues, with similar frequency of serious adverse events to the control group. The vaccine is viewed as a potential weapon in the fight against malaria, which still kills around 400,000 people each year, mainly African children under five.",

These deaths accounted for nearly 1 of 10 deaths from cardiovascular causes. 4 of 5 deaths occurred in low and middle-income countries, and 2 of 5 deaths were premature.

More than 200 healthy adults between 18 and 64 years of age were recruited to be a part of a group study.  They were split into two groups and one group received 15 micrograms of hemagglutinin antigen while the other group received 30 micrograms.  After 21 days researchers measured antibodies and hemagglutination-inhibition in the members of the focus groups.   In the group that received the 15 microgram dosage antibodies were measured at 95.0% while the group that received 30 micrograms was at 89.1%.  Researchers repeated the same test and received almost the same results.  No serious reactions were reported among the memebers of the focus group.   An estimated 56% of the group members reported pain at the injection site after receiving the immunization.  Another 53% reported having headaches after receiving the injection.  The results of the study concluded that adults who received the 15 microgram dosage were immune to influenza A.",

A study was done to examine the effects of coffee drinking on total and cause-specific mortality among men and women from fifty to seventy one years old. The study involved over 5,000,000 people, and over the course of the research over 30,000 men and over 18,000 women died. Coffee drinking did increase the risk of death, but coffee drinkers were also more likely to participate in smoking, which has a significant impact on lifespan. For men drinking less than one cup of coffee per day, the hazard ratio was 0.99. Those drinking six or more cups of coffee a day experienced a hazard ratio of 0.90. Women's risks differed a bit - women drinking less than one cup had a hazard ratio of 1.01, and those drinking six or more cups were at a ratio of 0.85. While this study shows that coffee consumption is inversely associated with both total and cause-specific mortality, it does not promote a causal or associational finding. ",
