    "text":"In order to assess the idea that the MMR vaccine causes autism, a study of Danish children born in the 1990s was conducted.  Researchers accessed children's vaccine records as well as their autism status via Danish government records.  Over 500,000 children were included in the study.  Of these, 82% had received the MMR vaccine.  Of these, approximately 750 were diagnosed with an autistic disorder or another autistic-spectrum disorder.  The researchers than adjusted the figures for potential confounders and determined that the relative risk for autism in the vaccinated group was 0.83; that same statistic was 0.92 fo the unvaccinated group.  This proved that there was no correlation between the MMR vaccine and autism, including no association between the child's age at the time of vaccine, the time since the child was vaccinated or the date of vaccination and the child developing an autistic disorder.",

Children who received whole-cell pertussis vaccine during infancy or who received pertussis containing vaccine after their 5th dose of DTaP were excluded. 277 children were compared ages 4 to 12 who were PCR-positive for pertussis with 3318 PCR-negative controls and 6086 matched controls. After the 5th dose of DTaP, the odds of acquiring pertussis increased by and average of 42% per year. Protection against pertussis waned during the 5 years after the 5th dose of DTap. ",
