They are constantly researching cancer and studying from the past 40 years to help eradicate breast cancer. They are constantly seeking knowledge in order to find more ways to stop cancer. Mammograms have significantly increased the early detection rates, which is a good thing. The rate at which women present with late stage breast cancer has decreased quite a bit. While there is still no cure, women are being treated earlier and thus are becoming cancer free and living at higher rates, than in previous years. Breast cancer has been commonly misdiagnosed because of the presence of benign tumors and similar issues, some caused by hormone replacement therapy. So the statistics about diagnoses, are not as accurate as they may seem at first glance. There is still a long way to go to lower the rate of late stage detection. Screening only has a small effect on the death rate. ",

The effects of sodium on blood pressure, according to age, race, and the presence or absence of hypertension, were calculated from data in a new meta-analysis of 107 randomized interventions, and the effects of blood pressure on cardiovascular mortality, according to age, were calculated from a meta-analysis of cohorts.

Only 8 of the 122 additional early-stage cancers were expected to progress, implying that 1.3 million U.S. women in the past 30 years have been overdiagnosed as tumors were detected on screening that would never have led to clinical symptoms. In 2008, breast cancer was overdiagnosed in over 70,000 women, accounting for 31% of all breast cancers diagnosed. Despite the increase in early-stage diagnoses, screening mammography has only marginally reduced the rate at which women present with advanced cancer, suggesting that screening is having, at best, only a small effect on the rate of death from breast cancer.",

Effective cancer-screening programs therefore both increase the incidence of cancer detected at an early stage and decrease the incidence of cancer presenting at a late stage.\n\nWe used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data to examine trends from 1976 through 2008 in the incidence of early-stage breast cancer (ductal carcinoma in situ and localized disease) and late-stage breast cancer (regional and distant disease) among women 40 years of age or older.\n\nThe introduction of screening mammography in the United States has been associated with a doubling in the number of cases of early-stage breast cancer that are detected each year, from 112 to 234 cases per 100,000 women - an absolute increase of 122 cases per 100,000 women. Concomitantly, the rate at which women present with late-stage cancer has decreased by 8%, from 102 to 94 cases per 100,000 women - an absolute decrease of 8 cases per 100,000 women. With the assumption of a constant underlying disease burden, only 8 of the 122 additional early-stage cancers diagnosed were expected to progress to advanced disease. After excluding the transient excess incidence associated with hormone-replacement therapy and adjusting for trends in the incidence of breast cancer among women younger than 40 years of age, we estimated that breast cancer was overdiagnosed (i.e., tumors were detected on screening that would never have led to clinical symptoms) in 1.3 million U.S. women in the past 30 years. We estimated that in 2008, breast cancer was overdiagnosed in more than 70,000 women; this accounted for 31% of all breast cancers diagnosed.\n\nDespite substantial increases in the number of cases of early-stage breast cancer detected, screening mammography has only marginally reduced the rate at which women present with advanced cancer. Although it is not certain which women have been affected, the imbalance suggests that there is substantial overdiagnosis, accounting for nearly a third of all newly diagnosed breast cancers, and that screening is having, at best, only a small effect on the rate of death from breast cancer.\n",

Since mammography was introduced in the U.S., the number of early stage cancer cases detected had doubled in just one year, while late stage cases declined.  Based on variables such as hormone-replacement therapy and other adjusted trends, the study concluded that breast cancer was overdiagnosed in 1.3 million women in the U.S. in the past 30 years. This has led researchers to believe that while screening is important, it has only marginally reduced the rate at which women are diagnosed with advanced cancer.  The imbalance suggests that overdiagnosis accounts for nearly a third of all newly diagnosed breast cancers. Screening has only a small effect on the death rate from the disease.",

Conversely, weight loss was associated with the intake of vegetables, whole grains, fruits, nuts, and yogurt. Physical activity, alcohol use, smoking, sleep and television watching were also identified as independent factors that influenced weight gain.

The authors estimated that in the past 30 years, breast cancer was overdiagnosed in 1.3 million U.S. women. In 2008, breast cancer was overdiagnosed in over 70,000 women, accounting for 31% of all breast cancers diagnosed. These findings suggest that screening is having, at best, only a small effect on the rate of death from breast cancer.",

Out of the 122 additional early-stage cancers diagnosed, only 8 were expected to progress to advanced disease. Breast cancer was overdiagnosed in 1.3 million US women in the past 30 years. In 2008, breast cancer was overdiagnosed in more than 70,000 women, accounting for 31% of all breast cancers diagnosed. Despite an increase in early-stage breast cancer cases, screening mammography has only slightly reduced the rate at which women present with advanced cancer.",

    "text":"A study by the National Institutes of Health has found that coffee drinking is associated with a reduced risk of death, particularly in relation to heart disease, stroke and respiratory disease. Data was collected from over 200,000 men and 170,000 women aged 50 to 71 in the United States. The study concluded that the inverted association between coffee consumption and mortality can not be determined as causal or associational due to other factors such as smoking. However, the study did find that after adjusting for tobacco-smoking status and other potential confounders, there was a significant inverse association between coffee consumption and mortality.",

    "text":"For breast cancer treatment to be the most effective, it is necessary for breast cancer to be found at earlier stages. To help further this, research has been done into this topic. The focus of the systematic review was that of trends in detecting breast cancer early, through mammography, from 1976 to 2008. While studies have shown that mammography has been effective at detecting breast cancer in the earlier stages, there were other things the study found as well that give less optimistic results. Taking into account certain trends in overdiagnosis and excesses due to hormone-replacement therapy, it was found that around 31% of breast cancer cases diagnosed in 2008 were overdiagnosed and around 1.3 million cases followed suit in the past 30 years. The researchers in these studies came to the conclusion that screening mammography has not had a large impact on the number of cases that advance to further stages of breast cancer, and consequently little effect on the mortality rate of breast cancer.",

Each person wasn't obese and did not suffer from a chronic illness.  Changes in lifestyles and weight change occurred every four years.  Every four years the average weight gain was 3.35 pounds.  Increased weight gain occurred most frequently with the intake of starchy foods, sugar-sweetened foods, unprocessed red meat, and processed meat.  Decreased weight gain was observed most frequently with eating vegetables, while grains, fruits, nuts, and yogurt.  Participants who took part in physical activities lost weight.  Those who drank alcohol, smoked, slept more than 6 hours, or watched television also gained weight.&#13;&#13;The study as a whole proved that specific dietary and lifestyle factors do affect long-term weigh gain.",

The research used data from surveys on sodium intake as determined by urinary excretion and diet in people from 66 countries, accounting for 74.1% of adults throughout the world. The effect of sodium on blood pressure was calculated from a meta-analysis of 107 randomised interventions, and the effects of blood pressure on cardiovascular mortality were calculated from a meta-analysis of cohorts. Globally, the study found, 9.5% of deaths from cardiovascular causes were attributable to sodium intake above a reference level of 2.0 g per day.\n",

Participants were assigned to a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with mixed nuts or a control diet with advice to reduce fat intake. The trial was halted after a median follow-up of 4.8 years because of positive results. The two Mediterranean-diet groups had good adherence to the intervention and showed a reduced incidence of major cardiovascular events with no adverse effects. The study\u2019s findings suggest that a Mediterranean diet can be an effective way of reducing cardiovascular risk.",

Data was collected from urine and diet from people in 66 countries which accounts for 74.1% of adults throughout the world. The effects of sodium on blood pressure according to age, race and presence of hypertension were calculated from data in a new meta analysis of 107 randomized interventions and the effects of blood pressure on cardiovascular mortality according to age were calculated from a meta-analysis of cohorts. Using comparative risk assessment, the cardiovascular effects of current sodium intake were calculated compared with a reference intake of 2.0 g of sodium per day according to age, sex and country. In 2010 the estimated mean level of global sodium consumption was 3.95 g a day. Globally, 1.65 million deaths were attributed to high sodium intake. 61.9% of these deaths occurred in men and 38.1% in women. 2 out of ever 5 deaths were before the age of 70. &#13;",
