They are constantly researching cancer and studying from the past 40 years to help eradicate breast cancer. They are constantly seeking knowledge in order to find more ways to stop cancer. Mammograms have significantly increased the early detection rates, which is a good thing. The rate at which women present with late stage breast cancer has decreased quite a bit. While there is still no cure, women are being treated earlier and thus are becoming cancer free and living at higher rates, than in previous years. Breast cancer has been commonly misdiagnosed because of the presence of benign tumors and similar issues, some caused by hormone replacement therapy. So the statistics about diagnoses, are not as accurate as they may seem at first glance. There is still a long way to go to lower the rate of late stage detection. Screening only has a small effect on the death rate. ",

Combining age categories, efficacy against severe malaria is 34.8% in the per-protocol group at 11 months. Safety is deemed equal for all groups. Incidence of convulsive seizures after vaccination was 1.04 per 1000. The RTS, SVAS01 vaccine is considered safe and effective against clinical and severe malaria in African children.",

    "text":"Effect of Three Decades of Screening Mammography on Breast-Cancer Incidence\n\nTo reduce mortality, screening must detect life-threatening disease at an earlier, more curable stage. Effective cancer-screening programs therefore both increase the incidence of cancer detected at an early stage and decrease the incidence of cancer presenting at a late stage.\n\nWe used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data to examine trends from 1976 through 2008 in the incidence of early-stage breast cancer (ductal carcinoma in situ and localized disease) and late-stage breast cancer (regional and distant disease) among women 40 years of age or older.\n\nThe introduction of screening mammography in the United States has been associated with a doubling in the number of cases of early-stage breast cancer that are detected each year, from 112 to 234 cases per 100,000 women - an absolute increase of 122 cases per 100,000 women. Concomitantly, the rate at which women present with late-stage cancer has decreased by 8%, from 102 to 94 cases per 100,000 women - an absolute decrease of 8 cases per 100,000 women. With the assumption of a constant underlying disease burden, only 8 of the 122 additional early-stage cancers diagnosed were expected to progress to advanced disease. After excluding the transient excess incidence associated with hormone-replacement therapy and adjusting for trends in the incidence of breast cancer among women younger than 40 years of age, we estimated that breast cancer was overdiagnosed (i.e., tumors were detected on screening that would never have led to clinical symptoms) in 1.3 million U.S. women in the past 30 years. We estimated that in 2008, breast cancer was overdiagnosed in more than 70,000 women; this accounted for 31% of all breast cancers diagnosed.\n\nDespite substantial increases in the number of cases of early-stage breast cancer detected, screening mammography has only marginally reduced the rate at which women present with advanced cancer. Although it is not certain which women have been affected, the imbalance suggests that there is substantial overdiagnosis, accounting for nearly a third of all newly diagnosed breast cancers, and that screening is having, at best, only a small effect on the rate of death from breast cancer.\n",

Participants with cancer, heart disease, and stroke were excluded. Coffee consumption was assessed once at baseline.\n\nDuring 5,148,760 person-years of follow-up between 1995 and 2008, a total of 33,731 men and 18,784 women died. In age-adjusted models, the risk of death was increased among coffee drinkers. However, coffee drinkers were also more likely to smoke, and, after adjustment for tobacco-smoking status and other potential confounders, there was a significant inverse association between coffee consumption and mortality. Adjusted hazard ratios for death among men who drank coffee as compared with those who did not were as follows; 0.99 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.95 to 1.04) for drinking less than 1 cup per day, 0.94 (95% CI, 0.90 to 0.99) for 1 cup, 0.90 (95% CI, 0.86 to 0.93) for 2 or 3 cups, 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84 to 0.93) for 4 or 5 cups, and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.85 to 0.96) for 6 or more cups of coffee per day (P (0.001 for trend); the respective hazard ratios among women were 1.01 (95% CI, 0.96 to 1.07), 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90 to 1.01), 0.87 (95% CI, 0.83 to 0.92), 0.84 (95% CI, 0.79 to 0.90), and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.93) (P (0.001 for trend).

Effective cancer screening programs show both a substantial increase in the number of cases detected in early stages, and a decrease in cancer presenting itself at a later stage.  Since mammography was introduced in the U.S., the number of early stage cancer cases detected had doubled in just one year, while late stage cases declined.  Based on variables such as hormone-replacement therapy and other adjusted trends, the study concluded that breast cancer was overdiagnosed in 1.3 million women in the U.S. in the past 30 years. This has led researchers to believe that while screening is important, it has only marginally reduced the rate at which women are diagnosed with advanced cancer.

They compared four groups made up of 40,075 women total with breast cancer. Two groups were from 1996-2005. One group received screening and one did not. The other two groups were from 1986 through 1995 and again, one received screening and the other didn't. The rate of death decreased by 7.2 deaths per 100,000 person-years in the 1996-2005 group compared to the 1986-1995 group. In women that didn't get screened, there was still a reduction of 4.8 deaths per 100,000 person-years.

In fact, the study estimates that from past screenings stretching back to 1976, breast cancer was over-diagnosed in 1.3 million US women.

Information relating to autism diagnosis and vaccination history were gathered from a number of national health registers. Of the 537,303 children in the cohort, 440,655 (82%) had received the MMR vaccine. After adjustment for confounding factors, there was no association between MMR vaccination and autism (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.24). The study provides strong evidence to refute the suggestion that the MMR vaccine causes autism.",

    "text":"First Results of Phase 3 Trial of RTS,S\/AS01 Malaria Vaccine in African Children\n\nAn ongoing phase 3 study of the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of candidate malaria vaccine RTS, S\/AS01 is being conducted in seven African countries.\n\nFrom March 2009 through January 2011, we enrolled 15,460 children in two age categories - 6 to 12 weeks of age and 5 to 17 months of age - for vaccination with either RTS, S\/AS01 or a non-malaria comparator vaccine. The primary end point of the analysis was vaccine efficacy against clinical malaria during the 12 months after vaccination in the first 6000 children 5 to 17 months of age at enrollment who received all three doses of vaccine according to protocol. After 250 children had an episode of severe malaria, we evaluated vaccine efficacy against severe malaria in both age categories.\n\nIn the 14 months after the first dose of vaccine, the incidence of first episodes of clinical malaria in the first 6000 children in the older age category was 0.32 episodes per person-year in the RTS, S\/AS01 group and 0.55 episodes per person-year in the control group, for an efficacy of 50.4% (95% confidence interval (CI), 45.8 to 54.6) in the intention-to-treat population and 55.8% (97.5% CI, 50.6 to 60.4) in the per-protocol population. Vaccine efficacy against severe malaria was 45.1% (95% CI, 23.8 to 60.5) in the intention-to-treat population and 47.3% (95% CI, 22.4 to 64.2) in the per-protocol population. Vaccine efficacy against severe malaria in the combined age categories was 34.8% (95% CI, 16.2 to 49.2) in the per-protocol population during an average follow-up of 11 months. Serious adverse events occurred with a similar frequency in the two study groups. Among children in the older age category, the rate of generalized convulsive seizures after RTS, S\/AS01 vaccination was 1.04 per 1000 doses (95% CI, 0.62 to 1.64).\n\nThe RTS, S\/AS01 vaccine provided protection against both clinical and severe malaria in African children.\n",
