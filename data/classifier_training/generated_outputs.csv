Two phase 3 trials have shown that adjuvant treatment with an aromatase inhibitor, exemestane, plus ovarian suppression, either through the use of a gonadotropin-releasing-hormone agonist, oophorectomy or ovarian irradiation, reduced recurrence of early breast cancer in premenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. After five years, the disease-free survival rate was 91.1% in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group, compared to 87.3% in the tamoxifen-ovarian suppression group. Furthermore, the rate of freedom from breast cancer at five years was 92.8% in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group compared with 88.8% in the tamoxifen-ovarian suppression group.

The results showed that at 5 years, disease-free survival in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group was 91.1%, compared to 87.3% in the tamoxifen-ovarian suppression group. The rate of freedom from breast cancer at 5 years was also higher in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group. However, overall survival did not differ significantly between the two groups.

As a result, two phase three trials investigated how exemestane and ovarian suppression performed against tamoxifen in premenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive early breast cancer. The hormones were suppressed using the gonadotropin-releasing-hormone agonist triptorelin, oophorectomy, or ovarian irradiation. After 68 months, disease-free survival rates were 91.1% for exemestane with ovarian suppression, compared to 87.3% for tamoxifen with ovarian suppression. Freedom from breast cancer was 92.8% for exemestane with ovarian suppression, versus 88.8% for tamoxifen with ovarian suppression.
