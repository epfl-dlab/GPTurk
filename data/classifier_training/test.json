All subjects received sibutramine for six weeks, and then they were randomly assigned to either sibutramine or a placebo. After 3.4 years of treatment, the sibutramine group had experienced a 1.7 kg reduction in weight, while the placebo group had not lost weight. However, the sibutramine group experienced a higher risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke than the placebo group, with no apparent effect on cardiovascular death or death from any cause. Consequently, the study suggests that subjects with preexisting cardiovascular conditions who undergo long-term sibutramine treatment should be monitored for an increased risk of such events.",

We used logistic regression to examine the risk of pertussis in relation to the duration of time since the fifth DTaP dose. Children who received whole-cell pertussis vaccine during infancy or who received any pertussis-containing vaccine after their fifth dose of DTaP were excluded.\n\nWe compared 277 children, 4 to 12 years of age, who were PCR-positive for pertussis with 3318 PCR-negative controls and 6086 matched controls. PCR-positive children were more likely to have received the fifth DTaP dose earlier than PCR-negative controls (P (0.001) or matched controls (P = 0.005). Comparison with PCR-negative controls yielded an odds ratio of 1.42 (95% confidence interval, 1.21 to 1.66), indicating that after the fifth dose of DTaP, the odds of acquiring pertussis increased by an average of 42% per year.\n\nProtection against pertussis waned during the 5 years after the fifth dose of DTaP.\n",

    "text":"High sodium intake, which increases blood pressure and is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, is responsible for 1.65 million annual deaths from cardiovascular causes, which equates to nearly 1 in 10 deaths from cardiovascular causes. This is according to a modeling study that used data from 66 countries, accounting for 74.1% of adults throughout the world. The study found that globally, the estimated mean level of sodium consumption is 3.95 g per day, and regional mean levels range from 2.18 to 5.51 g per day. The rate of death from cardiovascular causes associated with sodium intake above the reference level of 2.0 g per day was highest in Georgia and lowest in Kenya. Of the 1.65 million deaths, 61.9% occurred in men and 38.1% occurred in women, and 84.3% occurred in low- and middle-income countries, with 40.4% being premature deaths before the age of 70.",

    "text":"Screening mammography in the US has been associated with a doubling in the number of early-stage breast cancer cases detected each year, but only a marginal reduction in the rate of advanced breast cancer. A study found that between 1976 and 2008, the introduction of screening mammography had resulted in the detection of 122 additional early-stage cancers per every 100,000 women, with only eight of these cancers expected to progress to advanced disease. However, more than 1.3 million U.S. women were found to have been overdiagnosed in the past 30 years, meaning tumours were detected on screening that would never have led to clinical symptoms. In 2008, more than 70,000 women are estimated to have been overdiagnosed, accounting for 31% of all breast cancers diagnosed.",

    "text":"A new study has found that the antibiotic azithromycin may increase the risk of cardiovascular death. The research, conducted on a Tennessee Medicaid cohort, involved patients who took azithromycin, as well as those who took no antibiotics or other antibiotics. The study found that patients taking azithromycin had an increased risk of cardiovascular death and death from any cause during five days of therapy, compared to those who took no antibiotics. The study found that relative to amoxicillin, azithromycin was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death and death from any cause, with an estimated 47 additional cardiovascular deaths per one million courses. Patients in the highest decile of risk for cardiovascular disease had an estimated 245 additional cardiovascular deaths per one million courses.",

    "text":"Azithromycin, a commonly prescribed antibiotic, has been found to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death during a 5-day course of therapy, according to a study on a Tennessee Medicaid cohort of nearly 350,000 patients. The study compared patients who took azithromycin with those who took no antibiotics and those who took other antibiotics. During the 5-day therapy, the hazard ratio for cardiovascular death was 2.88 compared to patients who took no antibiotics, while patients who took amoxicillin had no increased risk of death. Azithromycin was also found to be associated with an increased risk of death from any cause. The observed increase in cardiovascular deaths was most pronounced among patients with a high baseline risk of cardiovascular disease.",
