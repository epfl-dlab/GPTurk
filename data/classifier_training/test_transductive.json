A recent study that took place over the course of twenty years has shown this. The study started out with a large sample size of participants who were free of chronic diseases and not obese and followed up with them every four years. On average, participants gained a little over 3 pounds in each four year time period. Weight increase correlated the most with eating potato chips, potatoes, sugary beverages, unprocessed red meat and processed meat. On the other hand, eating vegetables, whole grains, fruits, nuts and yogurt were all correlated with weight loss. Lifestyle factors also had an impact on the participants' weights. Physical activity was correlated with weight loss while alcohol use, smoking, not getting enough sleep and watching tv were all correlated with weight gain. ",

The study was a retrospective cohort study of all children born in Denmark between 1991 and 1998. The MMR vaccination status was obtained from the Danish National Board of Health, and the autism status was obtained from the Danish Psychiatric Central Register. After adjusting for potential confounders, the study found that there was no association between MMR vaccination and the development of autism. The study provides strong evidence against the hypothesis that the MMR vaccine causes autism.",

    "text":"An analysis of the incidence of early-stage and late-stage breast cancer among women aged 40 years or older over three decades (from 1976 to 2008) found that breast cancer was overdiagnosed in nearly one-third of all new cases. This equates to roughly 1.3 million women in the United States over the past three decades and more than 70,000 in 2008 alone. The overdiagnosis of breast cancer, defined as the presence of tumors upon screening that would not have led to the presentation of clinical symptoms, is thought to be due, in large part, to the increased use of mammography in clinical practice. While the introduction of mammography within cancer-screening programs in the United States has undoubtedly led to an increase in the detection of early-stage breast cancer, minimal effects have been seen with their use on the rates of advanced breast cancer presentations and mortality attributed to the disease.",

    "text":"High sodium intake has been linked to increased blood pressure and thus, cardiovascular disease. However, the effects of sodium intake on global cardiovascular mortality are unclear. A recent study collected data on sodium intake through surveys on urinary excretion and diet in people from 66 countries, accounting for 74.1% of adults globally. The data was used to calculate the global consumption of sodium. Blood pressure effects on cardiovascular mortality were calculated from a meta-analysis of cohorts. The study found that globally, 1.65 million annual deaths from cardiovascular causes were attributed to sodium intake above the reference level of 2.0 g per day. 84.3% of deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries, and 40.4% of deaths were premature. The study highlights the importance of reducing sodium intake to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease.",

The study aimed to assess the vaccine's efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. Children were divided into two age categories, and both groups received either the vaccine or a non-malaria comparator vaccine. After 250 children had an episode of severe malaria, vaccine efficacy against severe malaria in both age categories was assessed. Results showed that the RTS,S\/AS01 vaccine provided protection against clinical and severe malaria in African children, with a vaccine efficacy of 50.4% against clinical malaria and 45.1% against severe malaria. Serious adverse events occurred with similar frequency in both study groups.",

The study was carried out on 120,877 US women and men, who were not obese and had no chronic diseases at the start of the follow-up periods ranging from 1986 to 2006. The results showed that the weight gain over each four-year period was on average 3.35 lb. The study found that increased daily servings of potato chips, potatoes, sugar-sweetened beverages, unprocessed red meats and processed meats were most strongly associated with weight gain, while an increase in vegetables, whole grains, fruits, nuts and yoghurt were inversely associated with weight gain. Other lifestyle factors, including physical activity, alcohol use, smoking, sleep and television watching were also independently associated with weight gain. The study concluded that specific dietary and lifestyle factors are independently associated with long-term weight gain, with a substantial aggregate effect and implications for strategies to prevent obesity.",

Those taking exemestane had a 65% relative reduction in the annual incidence of invasive breast cancer compared to those on a placebo, with the annual incidence of invasive plus noninvasive (ductal carcinoma in situ) breast cancers also lower. Adverse events occurred in 88% of the exemestane group and 85% of the placebo group.

The challenge in quantifying the effects of mammograms on mortality was conducted in a nine year comparison study of over 40- thousand women aged 50 to 69 with breast cancer. They looked at the incidence in rates of death from the disease among those who had and had not been screened for breast cancer. The women were all offered a mammogram every two years. The data was analyzed between the two groups and showed the death rate was reduced by 7 deaths per 100,000 among those women in the screened group, and nearly 5 deaths in the non-screened group. This resulted in a relative reduction in mortality of 10% in the screening group. The differences suggest that the availability of screening was associated with a reduction in the rate of death from breast cancer, but the screening itself accounted for about a third of the total reduction.
