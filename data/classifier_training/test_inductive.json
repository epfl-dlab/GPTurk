All subjects for the study ranged in age of 55 to 80 years old. About half were women, and the other half men. They were grouped into three groups. One group was assigned a Mediterranean diet with supplemented extra virgin olive oil. The other group was assigned a Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts.

The effects of sodium on blood pressure, according to age, race, and the presence or absence of hypertension, were calculated from data in a new meta-analysis of 107 randomized interventions, and the effects of blood pressure on cardiovascular mortality, according to age, were calculated from a meta-analysis of cohorts. Cause-specific mortality was derived from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.

This significantly increased weight gain for those people who weighed in every four years. Processed foods considered were potato chips, potatoes, soda pop and unprocessed red meats. an average of 3.5 pounds over the 4 year period were gained. Or one pound a year on average. If these individuals ate a significant amount of vegetables, whole grains, fruits, nuts and yogurt one could help alleviate that gain. The study also concluded that for people who smoked or were former smokers they also gained a bit weight. The study ended by saying if several of these factors were watched, obesity could be avoided.

Each person wasn't obese and did not suffer from a chronic illness.  Changes in lifestyles and weight change occurred every four years.  Every four years the average weight gain was 3.35 pounds.  Increased weight gain occurred most frequently with the intake of starchy foods, sugar-sweetened foods, unprocessed red meat, and processed meat.  Decreased weight gain was observed most frequently with eating vegetables, while grains, fruits, nuts, and yogurt.  Participants who took part in physical activities lost weight.  Those who drank alcohol, smoked, slept more than 6 hours, or watched television also gained weight.&#13;&#13;The study as a whole proved that specific dietary and lifestyle factors do affect long-term weigh gain.",

    "text":"High levels of sodium consumption are responsible for 1.65 million cardiovascular deaths per year, according to a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The research used data from surveys on sodium intake as determined by urinary excretion and diet in people from 66 countries, accounting for 74.1% of adults throughout the world. The effect of sodium on blood pressure was calculated from a meta-analysis of 107 randomised interventions, and the effects of blood pressure on cardiovascular mortality were calculated from a meta-analysis of cohorts. Globally, the study found, 9.5% of deaths from cardiovascular causes were attributable to sodium intake above a reference level of 2.0 g per day.\n",

    "text":"A randomized trial of the Mediterranean diet for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease has shown a positive association between adherence to the diet and reduced cardiovascular risk. Participants were assigned to a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with mixed nuts or a control diet with advice to reduce fat intake. The trial was halted after a median follow-up of 4.8 years because of positive results. The two Mediterranean-diet groups had good adherence to the intervention and showed a reduced incidence of major cardiovascular events with no adverse effects. The study\u2019s findings suggest that a Mediterranean diet can be an effective way of reducing cardiovascular risk.",

    "text":"While high sodium increases blood pressure and is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease the effects on sodium intake on global cardiovascular mortality are unknown. Data was collected from urine and diet from people in 66 countries which accounts for 74.1% of adults throughout the world. The effects of sodium on blood pressure according to age, race and presence of hypertension were calculated from data in a new meta analysis of 107 randomized interventions and the effects of blood pressure on cardiovascular mortality according to age were calculated from a meta-analysis of cohorts. Using comparative risk assessment, the cardiovascular effects of current sodium intake were calculated compared with a reference intake of 2.0 g of sodium per day according to age, sex and country. In 2010 the estimated mean level of global sodium consumption was 3.95 g a day. Globally, 1.65 million deaths were attributed to high sodium intake. 61.9% of these deaths occurred in men and 38.1% in women. 2 out of ever 5 deaths were before the age of 70. &#13;",
